# Server Test

Provide some helper to test a micro-service application build with [`wai-axum-extra`]


## TODO

- [ ] Provide an example to use with rstest (fixture + once)
- [ ] Find a smart way to test commons routes without duplication.
  See wai-axum-extra/tests/route.rs and examples/basic-crud/tests/common-routes.rs
- [ ] Find a better way to expose the client in `TestApp` (trait?)
